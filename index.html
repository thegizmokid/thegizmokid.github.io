One of her biggest contribution apart from developing projects is being our DTF pilot trainer for Wave 2 Power BI trainings. Thank you Maico for your contributions and i truly believe that you'll do more great things in your current and future work. keep up the good work! ”</p>

								<p>“ Maico was a trainee at our Analytiks data science bootcamp. It was inspiring to see her commitment, drive, and passion to learn new skills and take on challenges throughout the course. This was especially evident during the conduction of the capstone project where Maico and her team worked together to perform an analysis on blood donor segments using machine learning and data visualisation. A true team player, her contributions to the project were significant as she helped her team overcome challenges in data sourcing and to create a beautiful functional dashboard that effectively showcased the results of the project.</br>

After the completion of the course, she has continued to actively develop her skills and know-how in the field of data science. I am confident that she will continue to excel in this field and serve as an inspiration to aspiring data scientists. ”</p>

								<p>“ I had the pleasure of working with Maico in two Data Science capstone projects. In these two group events, Maico has shown a positive learning attitude and willingness to understand the technical nature of the course. She has proactively shared her learned techniques in applications such as Power BI and Python to the benefit of the team. She effectively works well with others and constantly searches for ways to improve the output of the project. Her commitment to the tasks at hand allowed her to share her creativity, technical skills, and established knowledge of the subject which helped move the project to completion. As she progresses in her Data Science career, I can see she is equipped with good understanding of the discipline and of the business and can fully engage herself in more projects in future.  ”</p>
